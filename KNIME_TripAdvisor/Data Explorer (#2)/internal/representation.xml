You could miss it. Parking is difficult, especially for out-of-towners like ourselves who flee from $15 parking lots. (We DID find a meter finally and DID have an app to feed...\n\nMore &quot;,&quot;\nThe food at E Tutto Qua was really, really good. My friend and I dined here for the 2-week special Dine About Town prix fixed $36.95 dinner featuring 3 courses. Unlike some other places, the portions here were full sized. The place seemed to have more a local feel with many younger adults than one that is where tourists typically...\n\nMore &quot;,&quot;\nThis is by far the cleanest and nicest dim sum restaurant I have been to. It's quite fancy actually compared to the old and traditional Chinese restaurants in china town but they do serve great dim sum here and they provide you with the real dim sum fast service too. Yes their price is a bit more than the usual...\n\nMore &quot;,&quot;\nAmazing food, great family atmosphere, amazing food lol. Would return while in san fran in a second. A must see\n&quot;,&quot;\nWe just wanted a takeaway pizza, and found Pane e Vino had good reviews so popped aling to see if they'd make us one. The chap at the entrance said they would and that we could wait at the bar. I'm not a fan of Italian food and it's my partner's favourite, but both of us could have happily stayed...\n\nMore &quot;,&quot;[...]&quot;,&quot;\nAlways the best, freshest Italian food: calzone #13, the cold vegetables, the calamari, the melt in your mouth lasagna....mmmmmmm. Wood fired oven, great food\n&quot;,&quot;\nSincerely...what a delight to walk into this restaurant! We have four children - three of whom cannot eat gluten, including myself. The staff could not have been more helpful, they went through all of our options, that included not having to take something from the kids menu. Its so refreshing to be in a restaurant, that are so helpful when...\n\nMore &quot;,&quot;\nDefinitely the best Italian spot in San Francisco without question. The secret is out!! They certainly live up to their promise: the food is comparable and in my opinion better than several spots that I've visited in Italy! To be brief the lasagna is to die for, and the pizza is tremendous! The recipes were done to beyond perfection! The...\n\nMore &quot;,&quot;\nOkay, so it's really pizza and pasta, and wine of course, at Baonecci. We tried a variety of appetizers and I especially liked the bresaola while my wife liked the coppa, which is in the mixed tray of meats.\nThe wife judges Italian by the taste and quality of the arrabiatta and Baonecci's pasta passed the test.\nWe tried a...\n\nMore &quot;,&quot;\nTiny hole in the wall italian family restaurant that has great neapolitian style pizza. They have other menu offerings but I recommend you get the pizza and a carafe of the house wine.
